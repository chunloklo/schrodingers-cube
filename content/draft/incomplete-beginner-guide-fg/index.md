Many beginner fighting game guides focus on the basics of the basics. They go over all the ways in which to control your character, system mechanics, and any notable normals or specials that are useful. What I find problematic about these guides, aside from how they are often information brick walls, is that they often just don't teach you how to play. Fighting game mechanics and character move-sets can be really complex and interact in interesting ways. As a beginner though, none of that helps you understand the flow of the match, or rather, when to press buttons, and when not to press buttons. 

Here, I hope to outline many of the situations you'll encounter during the course of a match. Situation identification is one of the most important aspect of fighting games, and an experienced player will seek to confuse the opponent by constantly presenting different situations with different timings and preceding moves. So, especially if you are playing against a more experienced player, you'll still fail many many times to identify and respond correctly to the situation presented. But before you can respond correctly to a situation, you must identify what the situation is, because some situations won't look like situations at all in the first place. Then afterwards, if you want to look for answers, you can watch some high level matches, study your replays, study frame data, or going into training mode.

As mentioned in the title, this guide is rather incomplete. I don't intended to outline every single situation possible, as there are too many niche character or game specific situations to cover. What I do hope to cover are some of the most common situations that you'll encounter in any 2D fighting games. The ability to identify and answer to these situations should let you form the basic game-plan with your character.

Another incomplete aspect of this guide is that I'll not be providing you solutions to these problems. I might reference specific tools that are often available to characters to illustrate a situation or a common answer to a situation. But the tools available to you are character and game dependent. These situations will hopefully give the tools that you do have, which many other basic tutorials often go over, the context you need to start applying them. But I won't be teaching you that. It will be up to you to understand the tools available to your character and how to apply those tools to the problems I mention in an actual game.

Disclaimer: You can probably find versions of what I'm saying in many other guides scattered around. Here are where I take most of my inspirations from. However, I hope that this guide is a better condensed representation of all these resources to help beginners not need to dig into the depths of the internet. If you want to read them though, here they are: [put down links, machabo + airdash academy or guilty bits].


# How To Use This Guide
If you're learning your first fighting game, go mash some buttons, have some fun. If you want to get better after that, get to understand the basic mechanics of how to attack (normals, specials, cancels), and how to defend (high vs low blocks). Just have a basic understanding of what your character can do. Then after that, if you're not sure what your game-plan should be, this guide should provide some guidance on that.


# Rock Paper Scissors
If you're reading this guide, someone have probably already explained to you how block beats strike, strike beats grab, and grab beats block. While this is true, and is illustrative of the cyclic order of options that is in most aspects of fighting games, I would say that this information about strike, grab, and block, is only useful as describing the surface level of the game's mechanics. Instead, when this was



Many 2D fighting game systems, at its core, is a rock paper scissors system. If you've watched enough beginner videos, you'll definitely have heard how block beats strike, strike beats throw, and throw beats block. While that is true, I'd argue that it doesn't actually teach you anything about how to play the game. 


Playing fighting games as a beginner can often be scary. With so many options available at each moment, what should you do at each moment? After someone learns to control their charcter at a somewhat fluent level, one of the biggest challenge that I find is figuring out exactly what are the options you should be deciding between. 

Fighting games really are nothing more than a very intricate rock paper scissors. But before you can play the rock-paper-scissors game, you have to understand exactly what's rock, what's paper, and what's scissor. However, what makes this difficult is that players will intentionally mask these options with each other, making you think that a specific response is rock rather than paper or scissor. Identifying these situations is the most important beginner skill there is, and part of how one can start "playing the game". But if you have no clue what the opponent is doing, what button to press, rest assured that it is normal. 

What I find in beginner guides is the lack of this information on how to identify these situations when playing a match. They explain how to control your character, how to perform combos, but never explain how to identify fundamnetal situations that you'll see in the game and how to respond to them. 

So, that's what I want to do. It's going to be incomplete. It can't possibly cover every single detailed situation, every single set-up, and I'll speak in broad strokes. But that's kind of the point. You can learn the details as you play. Things will be very confusing at first, more so if you play someone better than you. Hopefully though, this helps you figure things out a little bit faster. So let's get started.

## Basic Match Structure
Fighting games are often described as almost rhythm-like and turn-based. Any point in the match can be really broken down into one of three different types of scenerios, neutral, defense, offense, and scrambles. We'll go down the list 1 by 1.

### Neutral
Many people say that "neutral" is the point in the game where both players don't have an advantage over each other. I think that statement in most cases is not true. Some characters can have "better neutral" than others, so of course that character will have the advantage.

The way I like to define neutral is that you're mostly free to move around the screen as you like without getting hit by specials. Your goal at this stage is to start your offense, and avoid having to be on the defense.
