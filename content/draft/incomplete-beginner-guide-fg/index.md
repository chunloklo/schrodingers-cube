Playing fighting games as a beginner can often be scary. With so many options available at each moment, what should you do at each moment? After someone learns to control their charcter at a somewhat fluent level, one of the biggest challenge that I find is figuring out exactly what are the options you should be deciding between. 

Fighting games really are nothing more than a very intricate rock paper scissors. But before you can play the rock-paper-scissors game, you have to understand exactly what's rock, what's paper, and what's scissor. However, what makes this difficult is that players will intentionally mask these options with each other, making you think that a specific response is rock rather than paper or scissor. Identifying these situations is the most important beginner skill there is, and part of how one can start "playing the game". But if you have no clue what the opponent is doing, what button to press, rest assured that it is normal. 

What I find in beginner guides is the lack of this information on how to identify these situations when playing a match. They explain how to control your character, how to perform combos, but never explain how to identify fundamnetal situations that you'll see in the game and how to respond to them. 

So, that's what I want to do. It's going to be incomplete. It can't possibly cover every single detailed situation, every single set-up, and I'll speak in broad strokes. But that's kind of the point. You can learn the details as you play. Things will be very confusing at first, more so if you play someone better than you. Hopefully though, this helps you figure things out a little bit faster. So let's get started.

## Basic Match Structure
Fighting games are often described as almost rhythm-like and turn-based. Any point in the match can be really broken down into one of three different types of scenerios, neutral, defense, offense, and scrambles. We'll go down the list 1 by 1.

### Neutral
Many people say that "neutral" is the point in the game where both players don't have an advantage over each other. I think that statement in most cases is not true. Some characters can have "better neutral" than others, so of course that character will have the advantage.

The way I like to define neutral is that you're mostly free to move around the screen as you like without getting hit by specials. Your goal at this stage is to start your offense, and avoid having to be on the defense.
