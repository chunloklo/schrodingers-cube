While I felt quite productive during the summer months of my internship while working, I feel like I haven't been the most productive recently.

I think part of it has to do with the freedom of graduate school, but also maybe that freedom is less of a problem.

It is hard holding yourself accountable for your own actions. I feel like I'm waking up later than before, I feel like I'm working less hours than before, I feel like I'm not sleeping as well as before. I just feel overall that I could be doing more.

I guess it comes down to the expectation of productivity that I have. It's like hey, I feel obligated to be productive today. And while I think that feeling of obligation is useful at times, I don't feel that obligation is currently making me feel like working than before.

So going back to what Matt Edwards have been saying before. Is this something that I feel motivated to wake up and work on in the morning?
My schoolwork certainly aren't motivating me I think. I don't have the deep drive for it that I do unlike when I'm running experiments, doing research, nor coding. 
I don't feel like I'm solving problems with my work right now. I feel like I'm doing exercises, with no reasons other than to practice without a direct relationship to what I'm doing in the future. 

But maybe that's exactly what I need. I need to take these classes in the context of research. These classes are supposed to help me understand deeper the knowledge I'm about to plunge myself into and do research in. It helps me be big, it helps me be more knowledgeable of the different areas of reinforcement learning so I can relate and tackle problems in these areas. My goal is to do research in RL. That's what I should be putting my time and efforts into. And everything else is in service of that goal.

So maybe what I should tell to myself is to not forget that goal. And even think about the broader goal of understanding research.

Yes, I do have a lot to learn. Yes, these classes will be helpful in the future during research. But I think they are even more useful when keeping that close to your heart when doing the exercises. You're doing this for a purpose. You chose to take these classes for a reason. Don't forget that.
