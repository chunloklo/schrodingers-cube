Hello!

Check out my previous site [Schrodinger's Cube](https://schrodingerscube.wordpress.com/).

I decided to start hosting my own blog away from wordpress because I want more control over how things looked.
I will eventually migrate over posts from the wordpress site to this current one. For now, please visit those site if you want to give them a read!
Here's the list of posts that I have made there and direct links to them:
