While other more descriptive mediums let us follow a character’s thoughts in detail, games let us walk in their world, make decisions with the same considerations, and deal with their world in a way that’s perhaps even more intimate and relatable due to its interactivity. Yet, in some ways, this empathy is still different than being able to &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; empathize with others, to understand another’s feelings and thoughts in totality. Walking in their shoes is only one part of the equation, understanding their thoughts is another, but in the end you really aren’t, &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. You haven’t experienced the world in the exact way they’ve experienced it, you haven’t thought the same thoughts nor made the same decisions as they did when encountered with the same problems. What I’m trying to say is that in the end, no matter how hard you try, there will &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; be some distance between you and another individual. You can’t inject their memories into yours as though you have lived it yourself, and even if you could, that is still insufficient because you are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. You aren’t &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, stuck in their body, stuck with their memories, and stuck in their unique position in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the quest for &lt;strong&gt;true empathy&lt;/strong&gt; between individuals is impossible. And I think that’s a saddening tragedy. You, as a unique individual in the world, will never ever be able to truly understand the feelings and the perspective of another being. Maybe you could understand them on some higher level, and communicate it with the same language that they do, but there will always be some &lt;em&gt;gap&lt;/em&gt;, some space in that understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe what I’m describing above seems minor, trivial, and inconsequential to day to day life, and I don’t argue against that, but I don’t think that takes away the tragedy and sadness of it. There are over 7 billion people on earth as of today, each with their own lives, perspectives, and experiences, just as your own. And ultimately, who you are, your specific circumstances and experiences, are only a minute part of all that exists in the world. The people we meet, the food we eat, the places we go to, are all drastically different between individuals. And I think that is something awe inspiring and beautiful, that so many others &lt;strong&gt;exists&lt;/strong&gt;, just like you, and me. Doesn’t that blow your mind? That over 7 billion more human experiences, just like the one you’ve had your &lt;em&gt;entire life&lt;/em&gt;, exists out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the experiences of more than 7 billion individuals, a vast majority of them would likely have a &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; different world view from your own. What seems ordinary to you, might seem extraordinary to others. And in the reverse, what seems amazing and unreachable from your point of view, might be part of their day to day life. Don’t you want to understand that? To feel, to live, and to think from a perspective that feels so alien and foreign to you right now, and have it feel as natural as blinking? To really understand and take that perspective of the world; to live through it, to think through it, to struggle through it; and to understand that perspective, not just through reason and logic, but through your feelings, your body, and your instincts; to &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; how someone could see the amazement in what you find ordinary, and the boredom in what you find exciting; and to know how someone could see the beauty in what you find repulsive, and the vileness in what you find charming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to not be able to do that, to &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; be able to fully close that gap in understanding, that is a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Silver Lining&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a brighter note, although I took a mostly pessimistic view above, I do think there is a nuanced, and perhaps empowering conclusion to be drawn here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of never being able to understand another means that others can also never truly understand you. Only &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; understand the world through your own perspective, only you know what you want, and only you have lived, as you. What I’m trying to say is that you are unique, maybe similar to thousands, millions, or even billions of other people in some aspects, but you are still you, a unique product in the world that no one else can truly understand aside from you. Only you, and not anyone else, have the sole privilege to live as you, And that also means your life is in your hands, it is up to you to stand up for yourself, to make the hard decisions in your life, and ultimately, it is up to you to strive for the life that you want to live. So go out there, live your life, because that is your privilege, and no one can take that away from you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Incomplete Beginner's Guide to Fighting Games]]></title><description><![CDATA[Preface: A Small Rant on Fighting Game Guides Many beginner fighting game guides focus on the basics of the basics.

&lt;p&gt;Many beginner fighting game guides focus on the basics of the basics. They go over all the ways in which to control your character, system mechanics, and any notable normals or specials that are useful. Other guides provide a list of combos you can do with your character off different starters, positioning, and meter. While all of that is useful to a beginner, my problem with these guides is that they often just don’t teach you how to play. Fighting game mechanics and character movesets can be really complex and interact in interesting ways. When I’m learning though, all I want is to understand how to get started, not understand every single detail about my character. I find that the majority of guides are like poorly written giant textbooks. They contain everything you would ever want to know &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; the game or the character, but they are incredibly hard to digest and hard to know what is important to pay attention to and what you can ignore for now. As a beginner, you can only learn so many things at a time, and many guides just do not prioritize what information is the most important and how it all fits together when you are actually playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, That Blasted Salami’s  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-RWtwZo728&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Julia Chang Guide&lt;/a&gt; for Tekken 7 is an amazing resource, but it serves more as a reference book rather than a tutorial. I can watch the guide, understand the content, and still have no idea how to even start playing Julia, aside from maybe spamming party crashers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because approachable guides are so few and far between, this is my attempt at a small how-to guide on fighting games that teaches you what you need to start charting your own learning journey. The goal here is to teach y’all a framework by which to understand the different situations and decisions during a match, which are at times hard to observe and understand. It is not perfect, and it is no doubt simplified and ignores many of the nuances that can arise. However, it hopefully provides the foundation you need to start learning from your own play and break down the information presented in harder to digest guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Who Is This Guide For?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve just finished downloading your first fighting game, this guide is probably not for you. Go play the tutorial, learn about the basics of the basics, and mash some buttons. You do not need to understand everything completely. Hop into a few games and play around! You will learn a lot during matches that reading guides or watching videos will not teach you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide is for you after you’ve gotten to the point where you know what moves you have, but just don’t know when to use them. Maybe every time you try something it seems to be the wrong answer. I was learning Eltnum in Under Night recently and felt very much stuck in the same way. I learned a few combos but I never managed to get the hit to start that combo in the first place. I was watching match videos but none of the mix-ups worked when I tried to apply them in a real match. I felt like I knew &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; my moves were, but I just didn’t know &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to play the game. I didn’t understand the different powerful options that she had at different ranges and how they related to each other yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;At first, I was very confused. Why did Senaru do the overhead here? Why does that never work in my matches? I could not find a single video on how to run offense on Eltnum. Not until I struggled by myself for a long time did I figure some of it out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m over that hump, I want to write this guide for the past me, and others who might be struggling at that stage of confusion. I believe this might be one of the hardest road bumps one might encounter for someone starting out on any fighting games, whether they are experienced or not. I really think that there really aren’t any good resources on how to learn after the basics of the basics. What do you do with the tools that you’ve learned? What’s the point of all of these buttons? How do you open people up? How do you form a basic gameplan? I’ve managed to get past this stage by scraping together bits and pieces of knowledge after a lot of struggling, but I think that process could have been a lot less painful if I knew what to look for in the first place. So that’s what this guide is, an attempt to give you the tools to discover your own gameplan with your own character with a little less pain and meandering than I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Rock Paper Scissors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lens by which you view something can drastically change how you think about it, and I believe it is the same with fighting games. Fighting games at their simplified core are just rock paper scissors, where you and your opponent both choose an option in real time and the better choice wins. The classic systemic view is the strike, block, and throw interaction, but I find that this view can trap beginners because it is just not true in a real game. Blocking indefinitely will not beat an opponent’s strikes, and opponents can still hit you when you try to run up and throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe there is another framework by which we can better understand fighting games with better applicability in game. This framework that I want to share is taken largely from one of my favorite existing resources called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guiltygear.se/gg-fundamentals/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GG Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;. While they originally presented this framework only as a way to understand neutral, I believe this framework is useful in understanding all stages of the game, and is applicable enough to build a gameplan around, so let’s get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this framework, all options can be categorized into 3 different types: preemptive (oki-waza), reactionary (sashi-kaeshi), and advancing (ate-waze). Similar to the strike, block, and throw interaction, each option wins against another option in a cyclic manner. The difference is that I believe these options are actually applicable in scenarios in game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-emptive&lt;/strong&gt; means striking the opponent before they strike you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the simplest form of attack. Just hit them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactionary&lt;/strong&gt; means waiting for the opponent to make a move first and reacting with your own move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This takes advantage of the opponent’s commitment to an attack to strike them back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing&lt;/strong&gt; means being momentarily vulnerable, then striking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This takes advantage of the opponent’s inaction to sneak in and perform a powerful attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Simple example of the the framework based on situations from Footsies (images taking from JWong&amp;apos;s stream)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, pre-emptive actions beat advancing actions, reactionary actions beat pre-emptive actions, and advancing action beats reactionary actions. Note that while I use the term “strike” throughout the description above, they are not limited strictly to normal or special attacks, nor are you always guaranteed a hit. “Winning” an interaction when you’re playing defense might mean gaining distance between you and the opponent. On the other hand, losing might mean the opponent is frame positive next to you, letting them apply safe pressure. Scenarios exist on a spectrum, and “winning” or “losing” a scenario just means the match will flow into scenarios that are more or less advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework is one way of bucketing different options and understanding the general interaction between different options. These options will likely be different at different ranges, and a gameplan is simply a collection of these options for these different ranges and advantage states (offense, neutral, and defense). When a gameplan is combined with smart decision making, it pushes the game towards scenarios in your favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as someone that is trying to figure out how to play, a gameplan is the foundation you need to start making decisions. What you need to do is find out what options are available for your character that fits in each category. And because the ways options get categorized into each bucket depends on the exact range and option available to each player, and there’s a lot of different possible scenarios, it’s best to focus on a specific scenario first and work out the different options available there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can find a detailed treatment of how this framework applies to neutral in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guiltygear.se/gg-fundamentals/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GG Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;, I believe the most important thing for a beginner to learn is how to run basic offense and defense. Neutral in a fighting game is volatile, with many possible ranges and options that can make it hard to initially comprehend. Offense and defense on the other hand are easier to learn because it is often more structured and with limited options on one side. Offense is also extremely important as it is the payoff from your hard work of winning neutral, and a major part of doing the cool thing for your character. So, the rest of the guide will focus on how the framework applies to offensive and defensive situations, how to identify when you’re in a defensive situation and figure out the options you have, and how to build your own first offensive scenario. So, let’s get started! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Identifying Defensive Situations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When are you in a defensive situation? You might have heard defensive situations described as “the opponent’s turn” and that is because it is true! It is their turn to press buttons! Why is it their turn to press buttons? Well, it is about what happens if you both try to press buttons at the same time. I would call a situation a “defensive” situation if the following two criteria are satisfied simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If both you and the opponent choose a pre-emptive action, you’ll generally lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ex. if you both try to press buttons/mash, you will get hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return on the reactionary action is very poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ex. the only “reactionary” thing you can do is block. Often, blocking will only lead to a slightly better defensive situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;As an example, take a look at Linne&amp;apos;s options &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; blocking Eltnum&amp;apos;s 5A in Under Night. If Linne attempts to poke out with 5A, she will be hit by Eltnum&amp;apos;s 2C. If she blocks the 2C instead, she is put into another defensive situation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of these two factors means that in a defensive situation, there is little to no risk to the opponent pressing a button! Identifying these situations is a crucial first step in playing defense well. It is sometimes not an easy task, as whether you are in a defensive situation depends on positioning, moves used, distance, and other factors. However, there are often consistent tells such as after blocking a specific attack at close range, or you are waking from a knockdown scenario. Another test is to just mash some buttons and pay attention to when you get hit vs when you hit them back! Though if you are trying to mash and are consistently getting hit, it is possible that you are not in a defensive situation but rather just not hitting the right button that is both fast enough and has a long enough reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Understanding Defensive Options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve identified a defensive situation, how should you think about which option to use? The key here is to understand that the opponent’s pre-emptive action has an extremely low risk to reward ratio. Oftentimes, the reward from your reactionary action (blocking) will lead to additional defensive situations (though this will eventually stop), meaning that the opponent gets multiple chances at opening you up. In defensive situations, one typical opponent behavior is to often use many pre-emptive actions, then mix in advancing options to force you to use pre-emptive options yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An example of Eltnum&amp;apos;s advancing options after a blocked 5A and it&amp;apos;s interaction with Linne&amp;apos;s 5A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been speaking in a little abstract in the above paragraph, so let’s give a short example of what these options map to for your character. A simple offensive plan by the opponent might be mixing in between performing a normal attack right away (pre-emptive), and run up to throw (advancing). On the defender side, you can either block (reactionary) to beat the normal attack, or mash a quick normal attack (pre-emptive) to beat their run up throw. Note that the pre-emptive option needed to counter the opponent’s advancing action might be different based on what they do, but a quick light attack will often do the job, but it could also be jumping back or back dashing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing defense well is about being able to consistently identify these situations, understand both you and your opponents options, the opponents tendency, and the current game state, to understand which option provides you with the lowest risk to highest reward. Playing defense is HARD. But it is supposed to be hard because it is a naturally disadvantageous situation (in contrast to offense, which is a naturally advantageous one). You’ll get blown up sometimes, and that happens to everyone, so give yourself some slack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this gives you an idea of what it means to play defense and the tools to look for in your character to help you do so. There is a lot more to playing defense, and I haven’t covered things like overheads and cross-ups. However, I would say the most important skill to develop is to be able to identify defensive situations and the pre-emptive and advancing actions of the opponent, then figuring out our own pre-emptive actions to beat their advancing actions. If you can do that, you can slowly process whatever comes your way and be on your way to getting better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note is that sometimes the options available might be tricky to spot or understand because they are “option selects”. Option selects are actions that can have different results based on the opponent’s chosen option, thus covering multiple options at once. Though note that as good as these sound, they are often pre-emptive and thus have their own weaknesses. An example of such a defensive option is “fuzzy mashing”, where you mash on a delay after blocking an enemy attack. This lets you both block the immediate attack and beat out any slow advancing attack! However, this fuzzy mashing loses to a delayed follow-up because the defender is often committed to that delayed attack. So keep your eye out and ask questions if you are confused!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finding An Offensive Situations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand defense, then offense is just understanding the game from the opponent’s point of view. However, I think offensive situations are even more important to figure out than defensive ones because messing up can potentially put yourself from an advantageous situation into a defensive one. You want to be able to take advantage of your own defensive and neutral plays and have it pay off into damage!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the opposite viewpoint of the defensive situation, the options in an offensive situation contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pre-emptive action that will beat out the opponent’s pre-emptive actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually the quickly attack that will reach at the current range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One (or more) advancing actions that can get past a reactive opponent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You run up into an attack or throw, or there might be specific slower attacks that your character can do that puts you in an advantageous position (to run more offense).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sounds simple on paper, finding an offensive situation and its corresponding options during a match can actually be quite hard. Each character has a lot of moves, and it usually takes a very specific set of moves to set up and run an offensive situation. You need to find a move to set up your offensive situation, and also figure out the corresponding pre-emptive and advancing actions. If you’re just testing things out during a match, the chances that you randomly picked the correct option is small and you’ll get hit as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eltnum&amp;apos;s options after a blocked 5A. The same situation as above, but now from Eltnum&amp;apos;s perspective!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these are the things that many tutorials are truly lacking: simple description of these offensive situations and the options you have afterwards. While I can’t do that here for you since I don’t know what character you play, here’s a few pieces of advice I have on finding the offensive situations for your character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at the frame data for your various moves. If a certain move is positive on block, then it is likely that using the move will put you in an offensive situation especially if it leaves you at close range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up the training mode dummy to block always and perform their quickest attack on recovery. Test out various attack strings. The goal is to find an attack string where the first hit sets up an offensive situation, and the second attack is a pre-emptive attack that leaves enough of a gap for the opponent to attack, but not big enough for them to hit you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch match videos and try to understand how the opponent got hit especially if they are already blocking. Find another instance of that exact same situation except now your character chooses another option. One thing I do want to say is that if you’re following this method, expect to be confused as the best players will have many many offensive situations in their arsenal and vary between each of them to not let the opponent catch on to any patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you find an offensive situation, add it to your toolbox and test it out in game! I suggest using the pre-emptive action more often in the beginning until you condition the opponent to block. Once they get comfortable blocking, then go in for the advancing action. But if you have a read on what the opponent will do, then pick the corresponding action that counters it! Slowly over time, you’ll add more of these situations to your repertoire and your offense will become stronger over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all I want to teach y’all about! When I first learned about this framework from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guiltygear.se/gg-fundamentals/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GG Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;, it was an eye opening experience to slot the many vague and abstract strategies that I’ve had playing fighting games into a neat overarching framework. And while that resource only applied the framework to neutral situations, I found it equally applicable to offensive and defensive ones. As a beginner, understanding even a single offensive situation can bring life to your play. It sharpens your focus during neutral and lets you build a gameplan towards getting into offensive situations. At the same time, you will also slowly recognize the options you have in defensive situations against the opponent when you play against them repeatedly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this guide gives you the tools to start charting your own learning journey in fighting games. Good luck, and see you under the Hollow Night!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What's Wrong with Motion Inputs?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Preface So, I had a giant draft about accessibility of fighting games and my observations about the problems with motion inputs for a long…]]></description><link>https://chunloklo.github.io/schrodingers-cube/motion-input-accessibility/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://chunloklo.github.io/schrodingers-cube/motion-input-accessibility/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had a giant draft about accessibility of fighting games and my observations about the problems with motion inputs for a long time. However, I never really managed to finish it because I didn’t have a clear idea about what I wanted to say and it was a little too much of a rant. In an effort to put something out, I’ve cut it down to the essentials. This piece isn’t everything I wanted to say on the topic of accessibility in fighting games, but I think it does a decent job at what I wanted it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I wanted to write this article in the first place was a worrying trend of simplification among recently released fighting games. Just to list a few, Street Fighter V was released in 2016, Fantasy Strike in 2017, Blazblue Cross Tag Battle, Rising Thunder, and SNK Heroines in 2018, and Granblue Fantasy Versus in 2020. These games simplified execution while lowering the execution skill ceiling at the same time, and as a result disappointed me, my friend, and I’m sure many others too. We love fancy combos, sick conversions off stray hits, and the hype reaction supers that we both do ourselves and see on the big screen. These games oftentimes just do not quite have the same bombastic craziness with execution in one way or another that made other titles so enjoyable to play and watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO1r6kRiP6s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/JO1r6kRiP6s/maxresdefault.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;BBCF EVO 2017 Grand Finals. One of the hypest set of Blazblue ever. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common sentiment in the FGC is that we want more people to enjoy fighting games, and that motion inputs, like ↓↘→P for fireball, or → ↓↘P for dragon punch, frustrates new players and turns them away. Many games like Rising Thunder and Granblue Fantasy Versus removed motion inputs or made them optional to be more approachable. However, not everyone was happy with the removal of motion inputs. Many community members defended their importance in fighting games. If you’re not caught up, you can read this awesome article &lt;a href=&quot;https://atmasarchive.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/why-motions-are-important-in-fighting-games/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why Motions are Important in Fighting Games&lt;/a&gt;, and watch these excellent Core-A Gaming videos:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgA_nK_w3A&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Consequences of Reducing the Skill Gap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WhbSNP_zF4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why Motion Inputs Still Exist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sUVNqNSo5M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Analysis: The Simplest Fighting Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is that the way these games removed motion inputs and the community discourse around it felt callous. In the process of making accessible games, developers seem to have failed to conserve the high execution skill ceiling that made matches intense to play and watch. In community discussions, there is an underlying belief that complex motion inputs are bad for accessibility, but I have yet to find a discussion on what made motion inputs inaccessible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion is my attempt to analyze &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; motion inputs is a frustrating and unintuitive system. Just like many others, I hope fighting games can be more accessible towards newcomers so more people can enjoy this awesome genre. However, many of these “accessible” fighting games are putting a doubt in our minds about whether a beginner friendly fighting game can have exciting execution opportunities. I believe so, and I believe that we can make a fighting game that retains the fun and interesting aspect of motion inputs while making it more player friendly. To do this though, we will need to better understand the success and failings of the current motion input system. Many people before me have already explained why motion inputs are awesome in great detail. Here, I hope to contrast that discussion with a deeper dive into how motion inputs can cause frustration, especially to new players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motion Inputs are Hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to onboard a friend of mine on how to play Guilty Gear. I’m sure anyone who has tried to teach beginners has racked their brain on how to properly teach someone a fireball motion. I’ve done the “so you go down, down forward, forward, punch” into the “wait hold on a second, stop jumping around and mashing buttons” many times over. Inevitably, they manage to get everything BUT a fireball, and I would have no clue what to say.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks game, this totally teaches me how to do the move!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that that motion input is not a player friendly system. There are many aspects of the system that can frustrate any player, especially new players who have yet to learn its intricacies. I see three causes of frustrations with motion inputs. The biggest problem is that motion inputs provide terrible feedback on failure and do not teach players what they did wrong. Second, it is extremely punishing to mess up motion inputs in a real-match situation. And finally, players are forced to master motion inputs before having access to the fun and interesting tools of their character. Let’s dive a bit deeper into each of these points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So… How Did I Mess Up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One underappreciated fact is just how many ways you can not get a special move when you try to perform one. Let me try to list the ways in which you can mess up the classic fireball input (↓↘→P), one of the simplest motion input there is and the building block for many others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could press punch too late&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could press punch too early, when joystick was at diagonal instead of forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could do the motion too slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could start at down-forward instead of down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could overshoot forward and end in up-forward instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could not move the joystick all the way forward (missing the forward input)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could skip the diagonal direction when doing the motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could have been moving forward before, so you got dragon punch instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could have been moving backwards before, so you got a half circle special instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hadouken!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine you’re a beginner playing your first fighting game. You have just seen Ryu doing these super cool fireballs, so you go into training mode and try to do ↓↘→P yourself. What do you get? Of course, you get everything but the move you want! Here’s what move you might have performed instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing punch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crouching punch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping punch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoryuken!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given one of the four outcomes, can you figure out what you did wrong? From experience, if you got jumping punch, you overshot the forward direction and ended in up-forward. If you got Shoryuken, then you might have been moving forward before and didn’t move your stick back to neutral before doing the motion. If you got crouching punch, you might have pressed punch too early, or forgot to go all the way forward. If you got standing punch? Well, I’ll have to see your input history first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the challenge there? There is really no clear way of correcting yourself given the wrong outcome unless you have access to the input history. In FPSs, if you missed a shot, your aim was off and you can tell how off you were instantly. In League of Legends, if you missed a last hit, you either attacked the minion too early (shown by the minion not dying to your auto-attack), or attacked too late (minion already died by the time the auto-attack reached). In fighting games though, there are so many different ways to mess up doing a fireball and none of the results give you a clear answer on how you messed up. This means that when you mess up a special move during a match, you would have no idea why and no way of correcting it. Of course people get frustrated. I get frustrated, my friend get frustrated, and we have several hundreds of hours in fighting games and get these moves A LOT more consistently than a beginner will.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt; My friend: YOU SEE THAT 5 CONSECUTIVE JUMP S THAT I DID? THAT WAS ME TRYING TO DO SLAYER&amp;#x2019;S SUPER&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that we’ve learned to get special moves consistently is go into training mode, turn input history on, and just start grinding out special moves until you can do them 10x in a row on each side. Input history gives you a better picture of exactly what you did wrong by listing the directions and buttons leading up to the point at which the fireball did not come out. I don’t think I have to tell you why asking beginners to go into training mode and spend possibly more than an hour practicing before playing is a bad idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh You Guessed Right? COUNTER HIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special moves are often powerful moves, whether it is dragon punching out of a wakeup situation, or keeping the opponent out with projectiles. They are also powerful in the sense that they are widely applicable and are often a good answer given the right situation. But when you finally identified the right situation to use your special move in, only to mess up the motion input, you didn’t just miss the chance to turn the tide of the match, but you also get punished harshly for the normal that you accidentally used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While execution failures can add tension and interest in a match between two players, it can also lead to frustrations to the person that accidentally failed to input the special move correctly, especially when it costs them the round or the match. Everyone has experienced getting counter hit on wakeup because they tried to wakeup DP or super. Everyone has experienced missing the anti-air special leading to the opponent getting a jump-in on you. It is frustrating because you read the situation correctly, attempted to perform the correct action, only to lose 50% life because you messed up your input.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Huh??? Where&amp;apos;s my wakeup DP? (This has happened to me too many times before)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not saying that having good inputs under pressure is not part of fighting game mastery, nor is this something unique to fighting games (you can say the same thing about whiffing your shots when you jump someone in an FPS) but I think the frustration when you mess up is undeniable. Imagine you are a beginner attempting to incorporate special moves into your game. You learned that dragon punches can beat out any jump-in attempts and try to do so when the opponent jumps. You get a crouching punch instead, and because of its slow startup, you get hit with a damaging combo. This happens over and over again. Now, you’re trying to play neutral, inching forward and gaining space, you try to throw a fireball to stop the opponent from running towards you. You instead get a standing punch and get whiff punished instead. For an experienced player, this might happen only occasionally. But for a beginner, it is something that can happen constantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add on the fact that when you mess up a special move input, you probably don’t know how you messed you either because there’s no clear feedback. You know what you have to do, you reacted correctly to the opponent, but your hand just isn’t doing the special move for some unknown reason. Not knowing how you messed up means you have no way of fixing it especially during an intense match. You can keep trying, but you will get blown up for it every time. How much fun does that situation sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Aren’t Playing The Game Till You Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execution gating isn’t something new in fighting games. Oftentimes, there is an easier option to do what you want to do. You can use a less damaging but easier to execute combo, or use a normal rather than a dragon punch to anti-air. If you can’t do the 1-frame link consistently, you can do the 3-frame one. So why can’t beginners just play without special moves?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of the reason why Under Night&amp;apos;s tutorial is so awesome is because it teaches you combos at different levels of difficulty &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that developers have been attaching awesome character defining moves to these motions ever since the appearance of motion inputs. Ryu with his fireball and dragon punch; May with her dolphins and beach balls; Rachel with George the 13th and Lobelias. These tools are a big part of what draws players to these characters. They are the moves that allow Faust to throw random items onto the screen and cause chaos. They are the moves that allow Sol to punch the opponent with his flaming fists for massive damage and command grab them when they start being scared.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why I play Sol&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that beginners cannot play without special moves, and they very well could, but they would often not be able to access the awesome and unique moves that motivated them to pick that character in the first place. Why would you play Ryu if you could not throw fireballs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have witnessed time and time again the frustration with motion inputs when introducing my friends to fighting games. Heck, even I get frustrated myself when I keep missing my DP or super inputs. It is frustrating to have the most powerful and the coolest looking moves hiding behind an ambiguous execution barrier. It can be demotivating to mess up a motion input and have your life bar disappear because of it. And no beginner will willingly sit in training mode for possibly hours just to get to the fun and interesting part of their character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can overcome all these problems I mentioned if you just “git gud”, but the frustrations that players feel because of motion inputs is nevertheless real. It is undeniable that motion inputs bring a lot to fighting games, and coming up with a system that maintains the benefits and the exciting execution of motion inputs while addressing its accessibility issues will be difficult. But I believe that it should be possible, and the first step is establishing a nuanced understanding of both the benefits and issues of this system. To me, it seems that motion inputs haven’t really been iterated on to address these fundamental clarity and frustration issues that I mentioned, and I think we can do better than straight up ripping out motion inputs from our games. Maybe there is a massive graveyard of fighting games that tried all sorts of alternatives without success. If so, I would love to take a look to see what we can learn from them. But as with everyone else, I just want more people to enjoy this awesome genre that I love so much without losing the spark that made it so great in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Summer At Riot]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is an edited version of my unfiltered thoughts after I left my Riot internship during the summer of 2019.

&lt;h2&gt;A little bit about where I came from&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on games was my dream when I chose to study computer science. I was super interested in art when I was in highschool, churning out pieces with other eccentric individuals in AP art late into the night. I even applied to an art school for game art. I decided that making art for others was probably not going to be my thing and chose instead to do computer science. I know I love art, and I know that love will always bring me back somehow, even without the formalism of schooling. Anyways, the core of it was that games have always been a big part of my life. I’ve spent hundreds of hours if not thousands playing my favorite games: Battlefield, Starcraft, League of Legends, Street Fighter, and many more. I’ve met many awesome people through games and helped me connect with others despite distances. I’ve laughed, celebrated, and cried about what happened within these games.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ah, yes. The amount of tears I&amp;apos;ve had over this wretched Protoss 4 Gate &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying computer science at Georgia Tech was quite eye opening for me. Knowing little beforehand, I found computer science to be a field that I loved. Computer systems, algorithms, graphics, animations, machine learning, and more, I found every topic to be fascinating. I immersed myself  in my classes, learning as much as I can. I joined various CS clubs and research projects. I’m the guy that will sit in on lectures for classes he’s not even enrolled in to learn more when he has the time. Slowly, games became less important to me. I didn’t have time for games when I was going to clubs, working on research projects, and implementing homework problem sets. There was a treasure trove of interesting topics and I was curious about what else is there in CS to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riot appealed to me for several reasons. I was introduced by my friend League of Legends back in middle school and have been playing since the end of season 1 (Judgement Kayle anyone else?). The other thing was, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are/values&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; really resonated with me as a competitive gamer. I’ll always remember the Day[9] phrase that went along the lines of “It’s actually quite unproductive to win. Losing, instead, points you clearly towards the direction that you need to improve at”, and “Focus on what you need to improve, but don’t forget to celebrate your wins!“. It is that exact pragmatic ambition that makes me want to see what it’s like there. Most of all though, it really was THE gaming company that I could potentially work for before heading off to bigger tech companies. The opportunity cost for joining indie studios was too high, and many of them don’t have the resources to take on interns for a few months in the summer. Aside from Riot, it will be hard to justify not going to big tech companies with better pay, more job stability, and better brand name recognition when compared to less well known and established game studios.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, I applied to Riot the first time during my sophomore year but was rejected because I was unprepared for the behavioral interview. I had no clue what kind of questions they would ask and they totally caught me off guard. After they told me that I was rejected, I was surprised that they mentioned that they can set up another call to receive feedback directly from the interviewer. When many other tech companies never even give a rejection email, of course I have to set up this call. The interviewer went through his notes during the interview and told me what his impression of me was and why it was so, and why I didn’t pass the interview. In the end, that session gave me insights into how I was presenting myself to others, and I came up with ways to better tell a cohesive and powerful story about my work history that was also helpful in other interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that feedback session, I knew I had to give it another try. This time, I have more experience and will be more prepared. I figured out the experiences I wanted to highlight based on what they will show about me. I know I’m notoriously bad at storytelling, prone to going in aimless loops that end up nowhere. So I memorized the key points and practiced it over and over again. I remember the weeks before when I was practicing for the Riot interviews, honing down the exact details that I wanted to tell, and making sure that I highlighted all the important points when I told my stories. This time, I got past the phone screening, the two on-campus interviews, and 5 more grueling rounds of remote “onsite” interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ecstatic when I finally got my offer, not only because it was a long journey to get there compared to other tech companies, not only because I practiced my butt off, but it represented a chance to explore a childhood dream that I had left behind. I came into computer science looking to make games, but I found much more that I liked. I never really revisited those dreams of being a game developer. The prospect of a run of the mill software developer is just too good, and I am finding there to be plenty of interesting work at these companies. What reasons did I have to find a job that has longer hours and lower pay? In the previous years, I also applied to EA, Activision, and Ubisoft for internships, but did not hear back. Riot’s offer was my chance to experience the game industry before I really hop off to some big tech company for the rest of my life. It was a chance to see the life that the highschool me wanted before I ventured off to explore computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expectation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t know what to expect going in. After the initial rush of excitement died down, I doubted my choices. Many of my friends didn’t share much of the same excitement as I did initially. Many people haven’t even heard about Riot or are interested in working there. Meanwhile, my friends were “climbing to the upper echelons” of internships at big tech companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon. It felt like a guilty pleasure, exploring a dream that felt perhaps a little childish compared to my friends. Gaming companies are famous for long hours and low pay, and with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kotaku article&lt;/a&gt; that described a culture of sexism within Riot, I became even more hesitant. Am I setting myself up for a summer of hardship in a toxic environment? How valuable will this experience be to my long term career? Even as I doubted though, I felt that I had to see it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to sound like a pretty drastic reversal, but my few months at Riot took away all of my previous reservations.
My impression of Riot was pretty well summarized by these jumbled few lines that I wrote on the flight from LA after the internship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What a place is this man. Thanks for bringing together all these awesome people at this place. This is not anything I would have expected. I guess I didn’t know what to expect. This place is filled with people that care about players, care about each other, and are passionate about the stuff that they are building. They aren’t afraid to speak up, to challenge each other, and to exchange ideas to find ways to continue to improve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really impressed me the most was about Riot was just the sheer level of care people had at the company. They care about the people that play their games, they care about the work that they are doing, but most of all, they care about each other. Whether I was playing games with others or asking them work related questions, everyone I’ve talked to has just surprised me with how nice, receptive, and understanding they are. We work as a team, we take ownership of our decisions and our code, and are open to feedback and quick to help someone in need. This extends beyond just my team. There is this meme about being aligned but people really are responsive, reply, get on calls, and just really care about getting on the same page and resolving issues. Someone went out of their way to address some problems with me and a coworker’s code, another quickly wrote tests to unblock us. A person that I initially found cold and hostile turns out to be so nice and friendly and ended up letting me talk directly with the Wild Rift team to resolve communication issues. Like when my teammate fixed a testing bug for passing error codes through http calls that I noticed earlier, and like what my manager did when he put a show logs button so it’s easier to send logs to us for debugging, it’s clear that people care about the things that they built. Our product was far from perfect, but it’s goddamn awesome that people just care so much. It was awesome that I got to chat and get in touch with so many teams, and while I won’t say there isn’t any drama, you can tell everyone is trying to be on top of things. People move around to different teams, transfer different responsibilities, but finding the people you need is never a few questions away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was part of the &amp;quot;Foundations&amp;quot; team for Riot Client&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I got the intern treatment, but you really get the sense that people care about you and your work when you are there. I remember hearing from executives about gauging burnout or stress level, teams trying to improve that for everyone on the team, and celebrating that when it’s good. A teammate and I were trying to get something into hotfix before the next release and had a passing thought that we might want to work weekends to make sure the other people aren’t blocked. Hearing that, an engineer from the Client team who we were working with immediately came by and chatted with us, telling us that no one should be pressuring us to work weekends and no one should be feeling like they have to work weekends. He told us that from personal experience that it is really easy to start burning out from experience, and that you need to make sure to take care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From working with him, he initially came off as harsh and we were both feeling the pressure. We were helping out with the Client team and so both of us were working in an unfamiliar code base and the problems seemed harder and harder as we kept taking more things into consideration. We joined calls and chatted in person on and on about details big and small, from code reviews to design comments, and in the end didn’t by the end of the week deadline that we set for ourselves. In the end though, it feels like I met someone who really cares. He is very well technically versed and thinks about many more long term consequences than we do. He cares about the quality of the code we are pushing out, cares about the future and extensibility of what we are doing and doing the best thing possible given our current knowledge. Most importantly though, he also really cares about the people he’s working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ended up taking a day off for mental happiness and stress and I just wanted to support him.  He’s not even on my team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1:1s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riot has a huge culture of 1:1s. There’s a rumor that you can probably grab a 1:1 with Mark Merrill if you really wanted to. You have 1:1 with your manager, your mentor, and your team manager. I had a 1:1 with our new dev manager when she joined our team. I think these 1:1s lets you develop a better personal connection with people on your team and within the company. Working together is much easier and more fun when you actually know the people you are working with. What this also means is that it’s a good excuse to talk to everyone that you ever wanted to talk to! I got to talk to engineers that I admired. I was curious about gameplay engineering, so I got 1:1s with many awesome individuals from the Champions team and the Game Modes team. It was awesome listening to their stories, where they’ve been and where they want to go. Chatting with everyone, it’s clear that they are interested and care about what they do. It might not be where they will end up, where they want to be necessarily, but they care about games, care about the value of their work, and that’s goddamn awesome. A tech artist I talked to really wants to improve the lives of designers and develop tools for them. When I mentioned script reviews to her, I remember her being really excited. Of course engineers would all be on board to improve the quality of their code. It was insightful when she responded with reasons why designers might be hesitant to implement such a system as it might unnecessarily slow down their design process. I guess it’s just that level of caring, drilling down and understanding what the problem is, that really gets me excited. Everyone is just excited to learn from others and make something awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was nervous early on to get my first 1:1 with people that I didn’t know well. But as my time was coming to an end, I was like damn it, I need to make the best use of my time. I chatted with a teammate who was joining an R&amp;#x26;D team, then someone else who I worked with and admired because they are honestly a super OP engineer, and then off to more people. If you go in with things you want to talk about, give a little bit about where you come from, where you want to go, and how they fit into the picture, you can end up having some really insightful conversations about your career, or anything you are passionate about. It definitely helped me get more perspectives on how to get where I might want to be in the future and what that future actually looks like. Regardless though, it was just damn awesome learning more about these people, finding out where they come from, what they are passionate about, and how they are going about to do the things they want to do. I ended up having such an enjoyable time that I remember basically having at least one 1:1 with people everyday for the last few weeks, up until the last day of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips to anyone joining Riot for internships or full time, I told myself that I would brave up and ask people to have 1:1s early in the summer. I didn’t end up braving the waters until a teammate was about to leave our team. I know it’s hard to put yourself out there, but do it anyways. Think about what you want to do in the future and talk to people that can guide you there. The trick for me is to always be prepped with questions and topics you want to ask beforehand. Who knows where the conversation might go, but it’s good to have that in your back pocket if you suddenly don’t know what else to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that has lent me their time. It was an amazing opportunity to learn from y’all and hear your stories. Each one of you inspires me to keep finding my passion and pursue it relentlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is undeniable that games are a big part of Riot’s culture. For those who wondered, yes I played a lot of games at Riot. I played more games than I ever did during my 3 years of college combined at Riot. Our team had weekly game sessions where we all get together and have some fun with all sorts of games, whether it is digital or analog. It’s a place where you walk by and see people just casually playing games to take a break from their work, getting hit up for post lunch games on Slack, and chat after work over a Rift game. Playing games served as my way of connecting with my team. You’d be working with them, but also playing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really more important though, is that people at Riot values what games can bring to people. Before this summer, it feels like I slowly forgot how important games were to me. The joy that they bring, the communities that they create. How the fact of playing together can connect people, can enable people to interact with our world in a fantastically different way. In MMOs, there’s the whole gambit of society. I listened to stories of our Product Lead stealing and scamming others in Everquest. We talked about the games that we are hyped about or are playing over lunch. I played intense matches of Street Fighter with my teammate from Poland when he visited. I shared my hype for Project L with other fighting game fanatics and played games to destress after work. In the end, it’s not about being diamond in League, and you don’t even have to play a lot of games to fit in right at Riot. What is crucial instead is an understanding of how games and play can bring immense value to people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me chilling with some TFT at my desk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I never felt more at home in the culture at Riot. It feels like everyone is there for a reason. People are passionate about the work that they do, the people that they work with, and the games that they play. It feels like the best part of gamer culture. People I’ve met are ambitious, hard working, genuinely care about the work that they do, but also caring and not too serious and down to have fun. I love how nerdy my team was, and it made me feel right at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kotaku Article&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this would be complete without addressing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kotaku article&lt;/a&gt; and how I saw it impacting Riot. However, I feel rather incompetent in addressing it in detail given my lack of engagement in activism. I do care about this issue though. I care for my fellow female colleagues, and everyone that I work with. Also, I’m a firm believer that toxic environments, no matter who it might be targeted towards, affect all those involved. What I have to say is that people are talking about it. We had sessions in our denewb that directly addressed this issue, we talked about it amongst our intern groups, there are Q&amp;#x26;As where people get to question Riot’s plan to move forward. I think the most important part is that people are talking. I don’t know whether the steps they are taking are good or bad, but I think this dialogue is healthy and useful for the company. Personally, I have not experienced, witnessed, or heard of any harassment during my time there. Everyone that I interacted with were wonderful people in accepting of each other’s differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ten Year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m super honored to have been there when TFT launched into blaring success.  It was exciting to be there when Riot finally released its second game. We got to have a sneak peak to the 10 year announcements before it went live to y’all and I’m sure every single intern’s jaw dropped as they showed us everything they have been hiding all these years. Legends of Runeterra, Wild Rift, Arcane, Valorant, TFT, everything was so hype. It was amazing to be part of something that just makes people so hyped up. It was awesome to see all the amazing art and design going into them, and to know that you are part of making that happen, that’s something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Intern Class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, the interns of this class are goddamn awesome. Everyone is unique in their situation, their interests, and definitely knows what they are doing. You can tell everyone is here on a dream, excited to have a peek inside to see what it’s like inside Riot. What’s surprising was how uniquely interesting each person was. One plays tons of league, others fangirl over e-sport celebrities, all the art interns are amazing at their jobs, and there was an engineering intern that just does these awesome graphic novels on the side. Just like everyone else I’ve talked to at Riot, it felt like everyone was here for a reason. They are ambitious to chase their own dreams, ready to push for the next steps of their life. They are thoughtful, interested, and driven to be their best and work towards that. They aren’t afraid to talk about workplace issues that came out during the Kotaku article. It’s not exactly one big happy group, as there were more than 40 people,  but I’d say everyone carved out their own happy place, and we are friendly even to those outside our own space. There was this sense that everyone connected with someone one way or another. I shared my game making and research ambitions with other interns. You’d be working with them, but also playing with them. And it’s both of those memories that makes it really feel special. There so many fun memories of going out to the beach, getting food, playing games (remember that awesome ARAM comeback that I fell out of my chair for in the Challenger room?), hanging out and watching movies, and getting excited and hyped over the unreleased games that’s all going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty confident to say that I’ve learned more at Riot about work than I have at any other internships. While my team assigned me a somewhat vague project of developing integration tests for Riot Client in the beginning, I ended up just being part of the team, picking up tasks that needed to be done based on our priorities. There were so many things that I learned just by being part of the team, whether it was keeping up with all questions and bugs coming in, or participating in roadmap meetings to see where we want to go. There were also amazing people on my team that asked so many great questions about the things that I did. What’s the problem you are actually trying to solve? Why is your code structured this way? All of my teammates amazed me with their attentiveness to details and desire to solve the problems. I’m definitely still working on it, but these amazing individuals forced me to think and grow beyond a person that simply does tasks that he gets told to do, to go from a person that pulls down and does Jira tickets to one that actually solves problems for the team. While I was slightly disappointed at first since I wanted to be on a game team, I’m super grateful for this experience that has let me grow as an engineer. Without a specified “intern project”, I learned the importance of being in sync with my team’s milestones, keeping up with the influx of questions and bugs we were receiving, and balancing a tight time budget with our need to learn and grow. I worked on features, build systems, testing, telemetry, and even chatted with multiple game teams like LoR about integrating our services into their games. No I didn’t have a giant shiny system to talk about in the end to show off to others, but I learned more about how to work in a team and be an effective engineer than I would have had otherwise. How to ask for help, how to support others, and how to build connections with others. These are all invaluable skills in actual work that will probably be harder to develop in a siloed “intern project”. What’s more important for me though, in this last internship before actually going out to work, is that I feel like I actually got to see what it is like working on a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![Group Photo](group_photo.jpg) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to give thanks to the Foundations team or the rpg-pp-pp-sdk team for an amazing summer. You guys are awesome and were dealing with some intense deadlines (probably even now) so goodluck and I wish y’all the best for the exciting times to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people ask me what was the best part about working at Riot? It’s definitely the people. Everyone I’ve met just seems to care. They care about what they do, they care about having fun, they care about where they want to go. Most of all, it’s a place that I feel like I’d never have to worry about caring too much, never have to worry about being too passionate about what I do or where I want to go. The feedback culture is real. People are open to talking about anything and everything and I’ve learned more from others than any of my other internships, and got to interact with some very experienced and meticulous engineers. Through it all, I reconnected with an important part of me that I never even thought I neglected. It reignited my desire to pursue whatever that I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who I’ve talked to at Riot, thanks for an amazing summer! It was awesome getting to know each and every one of you. Thank you to all those who lend me their time in our 1:1s. You guys inspire me to keep pursuing my passion one step at a time. To all the interns, you guys are so talented even on stuff that isn’t your job and I know you will keep being awesome wherever you decide to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why I’ve decided to come back this summer to join Project L! I look forward to meeting even more awesome and talented people and get to finally experience what it is like working on a game team!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aphelios and Champion Complexity]]></title><description><![CDATA[League of Legends’s newest and “most complex” champion, Aphelios, was released on December 10th.

With 5 different weapons available each with their own pros and cons, the champion can be confusing to play as, and equally confusing to play against. The Calibrum has long range, the Severum  provides healing, the Gravitum provides CC, the Infernum has excellent wave clear, and the Chakram gives massive close range DPS. Further more, Aphelios has an offhand weapon that affects the primary weapon ability’s effect and he can swap the main and off-hand weapon at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it in perspective, such a champion would have been unimaginable six years ago, when arguably the most complex champion at that time was Yasuo. Yasuo at that time still existed within the basic champions framework: abilities have one off effects that do not interact with each other (aside from his dash spin attack) nor the terrain. These abilities can slow, stun, knock-up, or nothing at all. Resource management remained simple, with either mana, some sort of meter that filled up, energy, or only cooldowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where as many of the older champion’s abilities are mix and matched from this basic toolset and might have one or two special characteristics involved, for example Twisted Fate’s card pick mechanic, Jax’s dodge, or Nidalee’s transform, newer champions break completely from this framework. In many ways, the history of champion releases shows the growth of the champion team’s vocabulary to craft champions with a certain playstyle or theme. There are more ways for abilities to interact with other abilities. The result are champions with a variety of playstyles and gameplay fantasies that are more intricate and powerful. You get to command soldiers with Azir, steal ultimates with Sylas, craft new items with Ornn, and fire powerful shots with Jhin.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see coinciding with this change is the growth in complexity for champion abilities. To offer these unique fantasies, these champions need specialized abilities that are unique from all other champions. I think it is surprising that these champions does not become overwhelming to learn to play as or against given their complexity, and I think there’s a few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;League is actually just a rather generic game with some power budget that each champion must adhere to and relatively well explored range of playstyles. In broad strokes, a champion can spec into several categories. They can spec into health, damage, mobility, support, and crowd control. For example, ADC has almost everything put into damage, with each champion having slightly different specs in other stats. Ashe, or example, spec less in damage and more in crowd control and support. There’s positioning that these champions perform their best no matter the complexity of their kit. With some exceptions, mages and marksmans wants to stay in the back line, assassins wants to dash in and out of the fight, etc. If you can identify which role these champions play as, then it is simple to decide a generic way to play against these champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is that the champion team often design specific power into a champion’s kit in clear and reactable ways. Often gated by their cooldowns and resources, or simply within the abilities themselves (think about Aatrox’s Q hitboxes), there are often mechanisms designed to make these champions weak/strong depending on how they decide to use their abilities. That’s a reason why the 3 hit proc is so often used by the design team, it is a clear and generic way to make time dependent power that is gated by you landing your abilities, while ensuring that the player is committing sizable amount of their own resources to trigger that bonus damage and giving the enemy just enough time to respond. For example, the fastest way for Vayne to trigger silver bolt is AA E AA which requires a positioning mistake. Kennen’s combo needs his empowered AA up which only happens once every 4th attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping these two things in mind, it becomes rather simple to play as or against a complex kit. The 100 effects attached to each champion’s ability simple defines a specified way to play as and against the champion. It matters less how exactly the damage dealt to you is calculated or what other passives it has (unless you are trying to calculate for specific power spikes, or really diving deep into the champion. In that case, you would be reading their ability description in detail anyways), but rather what should you do when seeing this champion on the rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhin’s passive is a big long paragraph. But all this paragraph means is that you want to play around his the bonus damage on his fourth shot and the movement speed he gains afterwards. As an enemy, stay away from his 4th shot especially when you are low on health, and trade with him when he is reloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhin’s passive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhin’s hand cannon, Whisper, is a precise instrument designed to deal superior damage. It fires at a fixed rate and carries only four shots. Upon firing all four shots or not attacking for 10 seconds, Jhin has to reload for 2.5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhin imbues the final bullet with dark magics, guaranteeing it to critically strike and deal 15 / 20 / 25% of his target’s missing Health as bonus physical damage. Against structures, the critical strike damage of this bullet is reduced by 44% and the bonus damage is not applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhin’s critical strikes deal 25% reduced damage, but grant 10% (+4% per 10% bonus attack speed) movement speed for 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Jhin’s attack damage is increased by 4-44% (based on level) (+4% per 10% critical chance) (+2.5% per 10% bonus attack speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about Aphelios is that while he follows the above framework, the exact way to play against him is inconsistent with his 10 different weapon combinations. While there are lot of generalization on how to play as or against him in each combination (he has no dashes/blinks), there are still specific strength and weaknesses that both the player and the opponent have to exploit. You need to be aware of his heal and movement speed with Severum, his slow and snare with Gravitum, and his AOE damage with Infernum. Just as Aphelios might approach a fight differently with different weapons, his opponent also needs to respond accordingly. In that way, the enemies needs to be able to understand and respond to 10 slightly different version of a marksman to playing against Aphelios, and so requires them to have a more intimite knowledge of his kit than other champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State change champions are not new in League of Legends. Before the release of Aphelios, Riot have released Nidalee, Jayce, Gnar, Kled, Elise, Shyvana, and Qiyana. In that sense, Aphelios share the most in common with Gnar and Kled, whose transformations are “uncontrollable” and drastically changes their kit. While Aphelios’ “transformations” are a lot tamer than Gnar and Kled, the sheer number of possible states makes Aphelios difficult to approach. Aphelios players will be the first ones to understand the benefits of each combination of weapons, and players playing against him will need to also understand the pros and cons of those 10 states. The sheer number of states makes it hard for enemy players to learn to deal the champion just through experience alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Riot Stashu on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/11/champion-insights-aphelios/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aphelios champion insight&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the benefits of not being able to choose which weapon you have is that we could make the combination of his weapons super OP in different situations”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of the ammo, you force players into a scenario where they need to recognize their strengths at that exact moment. You can give them this combination of weapons that’s really strong for dueling so they think, ‘Oh damn. I have to fight RIGHT NOW.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he left out the point that the enemy also needs to be able to recognize those situations in order to play effectively against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, although I think the champion team does a good job on making unique and rewarding champions that remain simple to play as or against despite their complexities, I’m not sure if there’s a solution for Aphelios’ case. The nature of his kit will make him one of the more complex champion to play against due to his varied strength and weaknesses depending on the weapons he has equipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because his state change nature is such a complex and important part of his kit, enemies will also need to understand how it functions in order to properly play against him. Just as any immobile marksmen, the general solution of course is to just delete him from the fight using crowd control and damage. However, the inconsistent way in which he has the ability to combat dive (Calibrum gives him range, Gravitum gives him slow/root, Severum gives him movemenet speed and sustain) will no doubt gives enemy frustrations when they do not understand what exactly to look out for. What Riot can only do is to give him more clarity, and be more clear on which weapons he has equipped and will be equipped, and the ammo count on each of those weapons. Fortunately, it looks like they are already looking into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/1207356431101358080&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Experiment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello!
